== Storage Guidelines

Proper storage helps prevent damage to paint, seams, and materials. Follow these steps:

. To store an inflatable safely without damaging paint or seams:
** Remove all air from the chambers but leave the valves open.
** Lay out all seams flat.
** Roll the inflatable either clockwise or counterclockwise.
** Close the valves quickly after rolling to expel any remaining air.
** This method is not space-efficient but is the safest, as it minimizes bent corners.

. Use undyed and unwaxed cotton bags (also known as canvas bags) for storing vinyl or latex inflatables. These bags should be similar in color to the following example: +
image:LEAFICO_cotton_bags.jpg[480,240]

. Avoid storing inflatables in:
** Plastic bags (e.g., Ziploc), as they leach plasticizers.
** Dyed or pigmented fabric bags, as they can permanently stain vinyl.

. If inflating with lung air (via mouth):
** Deflate the item first.
** Re-inflate with dry air to dry out the interior and prevent mold buildup.
** Note: Vinyl can also mold externally, but cotton bags allow airflow, reducing this risk.

. For long-term storage, avoid:
** Hanging vinyl or latex items on a hanger.
** Allowing vinyl or latex to touch itself if using ATBC plasticizer (instead of DINP). To prevent sticking, place thin foam sheets (1/16" thickness) between layers. Alternatively, use corn starch for vinyl or unscented talcum powder for latex (though messier).

. Materials harmful to vinyl upon contact:
** Baby oil, coconut oil, mineral oil, silicone-based lube, vegetable oil, lithium grease, WD-40 (and other solvent-containing sprays).
** Concentrated dish soap (non-concentrated dish soap is safe for both vinyl and latex).
** Water-based lube and petroleum jelly (Vaseline) are safe short-term for vinyl but unsafe for latex; wash off promptly.
** Non-vinyl glues, such as Gorilla Glue or other superglue products.
** Duct tape or other tapes not designed for vinyl.

== Cleaning Procedures

Regular cleaning maintains the inflatable's condition. Use these methods:

* To remove marks or scuffs, use a dry pencil eraser first. If ineffective, wet the area with water and try erasing again.

.Recommended at least every 3 days during active use:
. Prepare a cleaning solution in a 950 mL (32 oz) spray bottle:
** Fill halfway with warm water.
** Add 60 mL (4 tablespoons) of non-concentrated dish soap.
** Top off with warm water.

. Use two microfiber cloths: one for wiping off soap and one for drying.

== Detecting Leaks

To find leaks effectively:

. Inflate the item until it feels very firm.

. Apply an even mixture from the prepared spray bottle and spread it with your hands, making the surface feel soapy.
** Look for expanding bubbles, which may take hours to appear unless pressure is applied to suspected areas.

== Applying Vinyl Glue

=== Safety Warnings
. Work outdoors if possible to minimize hazards.

. If working indoors:
** Ensure rapid air exhaustion using a high-velocity fan or similar.
** Avoid working near electronics, as sparks with fumes can cause flash fires.
** Wear a gas mask or painter respirator, such as the https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-770030L-North-Facepiece-Silicone/dp/B009SB4YUY[Honeywell North 7700 series]. Cheaper options like 3M exist but may require frequent replacement.

. Handle vinyl glue with latex gloves, as it is toxic before drying. Avoid nitrile gloves as it can stick to the glue.

. Use vinyl no thicker than 0.4mm (16 gauge/16 mil) for patches or reinforcements. Thicker vinyl (0.6mm+) is difficult to cut, adheres poorly, and stresses surrounding material. For 0.3mm (12 gauge/12 mil) inflatables (e.g., from Inflatable World), match the thickness.

=== Seam Types and Information
. *Pinch seams*: Common and cost-effective; formed by pinching and welding vinyl. Recognizable by a raised lip.
** Prone to splitting under stress; reinforce by gluing a vinyl strip over the seam to bond both sides.
** image:pinch_seam.png[480,240]

. *Negative curves*: Curved pinch seams (e.g., head to nose). Identified by higher tension.
** Reinforce similarly to pinch seams.
** image:negative_curve.jpg[480,240]

. *Flat seams*: Durable and costly; overlapping vinyl welded on both sides. Generally does not require repair.
** image:flat_seams.jpg[480,240]

=== The Procedure
. Purchase glue:
** https://rhadhesives.com/product/hh-66-vinyl-cement-product/[HH-66 Vinyl Cement] (gold standard, though availability varies by country).
** https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_vinyl_fabricplasticflexibleadhesive.html[Loctite Vinyl, Fabric & Plastic Adhesive] (higher price, easier application but lower quality).

. Acquire tools:
** Rotary cutter: https://www.amazon.com/Olfa-Deluxe-Rotary-Cutter-60mm/dp/B001CE5DLE[Olfa's 60mm ergonomic model] for ease and replaceable blades.
** Brayer roller: https://www.amazon.com/VinBee-Rubber-Brayer-Applicator-Painting/dp/B07R8PMSVB[VinBee's soft rubber tool] (avoid latex-containing options).
** Paper guillotine: https://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-Heavy-Guillotine-Trimmer-Inches/dp/B0006HVQH8[X-ACTO 15"] for value and size.
** Scissors: Tim Holtz https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Holtz-Small-Titanium-Scissors/dp/B0013JNERS[7 inch] for trimming miscuts and https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Holtz-Scissors-All-Purpose/dp/B00JG9OV5G[9.5 inch] for cutting strips (use guillotine when possible).
** Practice items: Multiple https://www.amazon.com/Intex-Whale-Inflatable-Pool-Ride/dp/B00004YTPV[Intex Orcas] for chamber separation and seam reinforcement; https://www.amazon.com/Intex-Unicorn-Inflatable-Ride-Float/dp/B073685W74[Intex Unicorn Ride-Ons] for negative seams.

. Cutting vinyl:
** Use rotary cutter along a ruler on a self-healing mat (OLFA or Dahle brand) for straight cuts.
** Correct veering with scissors.
** Use a paper guillotine for precise cuts on smaller sheets; sizes vary by inflatable.

. Dispensing glue: Fill a 10mL syringe with HH-66, I recommend starting with 4mL of glue for small repairs, and attach a 19-gauge blunt tip (lower gauges leak; higher is too restrictive). 
- Avoid air in syringe.
- If there's air in the syringe, tap hard repeatedly where the bubbles are to force those bubbles to move up the syringe, then push the syringe until glue comes out.

. Clean the surface of the inflatable for where you wish to glue with alcohol. Be sure to test in a non-visible part of the inflatable on whether this removes paint or not before proceeding.
- Optionally, use a UV flashlight for inspection; wear polycarbonate goggles to protect your eyes from UV light (e.g., https://www.amazon.com/NoCry-Safety-Goggles-Over-Glasses/dp/B08Y5JTKMQ[NoCry ANSI Z87.1 Goggles] or https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8[Tool Klean Safety Glasses]).
** Read 1lumen's "https://1lumen.com/best-uv-flashlight[The Best UV Flashlights tested]" for tips on what to buy.

. Apply glue:
** Evenly and thinly, spread out under the vinyl strip. Do not directly put glue on the inflatable.
** Work in sections slowly.
** Avoid excess in one area.
** At the edge of each strip to finish it off and close it up. You should use at least two layers of glue (wait for the previous coat of glue to dry before doing another) to ensure a proper seal.

. For the vinyl strips:
** Make them each 2cm wide, no smaller, no larger.
** Apply pressure to each glued down vinyl strip for no less than 25 seconds. Ensure the pressure doesn't cause creases and keeps the vinyl strip flat.

=== Tips and Tricks
. Heat (e.g., from sunlight) aids glue removal.

. Cut the corners of your vinyl strips to be rounded. Neglecting this will lead to patches that pry up overtime from skin oil exposure.

. Glue pinhole leaks while inflated. It can be still soapy from the spray you used to detect pinhole leaks, the glue will continue to stick. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nekhnT0rI&list=PL5_NdwXbrBVsTo8x8MIfr6TTWFCJoZ9Xp&index=9&pp=iAQB[A video example].

. Leaks can be deeper inside vinyl instead of at the edges, meaning gluing the edges wouldn't fully solve the issue. Press and feel around the leak, try to make bubbles come out from the pressure of your finger(s).
** If it's multi-layered vinyl, you may have to create a 19 gauge needle sized hole and inject glue in if the leak is deep.

== Inflation Tools
* Double-action hand pump: https://www.amazon.com/Texsport-Double-Action-Hand-Mattress/dp/B000P9IRVK[Texsport].

** Reduce its noise and heat with a https://www.amazon.com/Versatile-Motor-Speed-Controller-Protection/dp/B09LQP5RDB[motor speed controller]. 
** Also include a https://metrovac.com/products/inflator-adapter[MVC-211C-AS] adapter with your purchase.

== Plasticizer section

=== DINP or ATBC?
- DINP has greater elasticity, does not damage paint, and reduces leaching from skin oils or sunlight. May prevent paint cracking by enhancing flexibility.

- ATBC is safer health-wise but harmful to inflatables; I will offer no assistance for it.
** DINP's risks are lower than other phthalates (e.g., DEP, DEHP), especially non-aerosol forms. DINCH would be better, however I do not know how to source it.

=== Key Studies on DINP Health Effects (read in order)
. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7460375/[Critical Review on the Presence of Phthalates in Food and Evidence of Their Biological Impact]
. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8677456/[The Impact of Di-Isononyl Phthalate Exposure on Specialized Epithelial Cells in the Colon]

Technical Support Document for the Risk Evaluation]

=== Safety or Other Warnings
. There is higher exposure from mouthing DINP-treated vinyl (per EPA) than touching it. Touching it is safe once DINP is absorbed into the inflatable.
** In the European Union they've restricted usage of DINP in toys that can be taken into the mouth.

. Use latex gloves during application.

. Wash if there's skin contact with HH-66 glue or DINP immediately.

. Apply DINP internally via the inflatable's valve(s) for safety; this will weaken seams compared to applying them externally with gloves on.

. Alibaba sellers overcharge for DINP (~$100/kg + $80+ shipping).

. Some suppliers (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich) restrict to approved buyers only. Meaning you'd need to be a chemist working for a company, and to order the ATBC/DINP/DINCH through said company.

. Beware of diluted products (e.g., with sunflower oil, harmful to inflatables).

== Enlarging an Inflatable
CAUTION: This weakens seams and causes permanent deformation.

.Methods include:
. Prolonged direct sunlight exposure.

. Using a steam cleaner to inject steam.

. Over-inflating for 3 days (accelerated by high humidity/temperature).

== [TODO] Vinyl Glue Removal
. Use https://rhadhesives.com/product/hh-66-thinner/[HH-66 Thinner] or acetone via blunt-tip syringes (avoid cotton swabs).
. Combine with hair dryer for residue removal.

== [TODO] Painting Vinyl
. Use a https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D9NJZHJS[Gocheer Airbrush Kit - 48 PSI] for compact touch-ups.
