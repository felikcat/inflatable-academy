== Storage Guidelines

Proper storage helps prevent damage to paint, seams, and materials. Follow these steps:

. To store an inflatable safely without damaging paint or seams:
** Remove all air from the chambers but leave the valves open.
** Lay out all seams flat.
** Roll the inflatable either clockwise or counterclockwise.
** Close the valves quickly after rolling to expel any remaining air.
** This method is not space-efficient but is the safest, as it minimizes bent corners.

. Use undyed and unwaxed cotton bags (also known as canvas bags) for storing vinyl or latex inflatables. These bags should be similar in color to the following example: +
image:LEAFICO_cotton_bags.jpg[480,240]

. Avoid storing inflatables in:
** Plastic bags (e.g., Ziploc), as they leach plasticizers.
** Dyed or pigmented fabric bags, as they can permanently stain vinyl.

. If inflating with lung air (via mouth):
** Deflate the item first.
** Re-inflate with dry air to dry out the interior and prevent mold buildup.
** Note: Vinyl can also mold externally, but cotton bags allow airflow, reducing this risk.

. For long-term storage, avoid:
** Hanging vinyl or latex items on a hanger.
** Allowing vinyl or latex to touch itself if using ATBC plasticizer (instead of DINP). To prevent sticking, place thin foam sheets (1/16" thickness) between layers. Alternatively, use corn starch for vinyl or unscented talcum powder for latex (though messier).

. Materials harmful to vinyl upon contact:
** Baby oil, coconut oil, mineral oil, silicone-based lube, vegetable oil, lithium grease, WD-40 (and other solvent-containing sprays).
** Concentrated dish soap (non-concentrated dish soap is safe for both vinyl and latex).
** Water-based lube and petroleum jelly (Vaseline) are safe short-term for vinyl but unsafe for latex; wash off promptly.
** Non-vinyl glues, such as Gorilla Glue or other superglue products.
** Duct tape or other tapes not designed for vinyl.

== Cleaning Procedures

Regular cleaning maintains the inflatable's condition. Use these methods:

* To remove marks or scuffs, use a dry pencil eraser first. If ineffective, wet the area with water and try erasing again.

.Recommended at least every 3 days during active use:
. Prepare a cleaning solution in a 950 mL (32 oz) spray bottle:
** Fill halfway with warm water.
** Add 60 mL (4 tablespoons) of non-concentrated dish soap.
** Top off with warm water.

. Use two microfiber cloths: one for wiping off soap and one for drying.

== Detecting Leaks

To find leaks effectively:

. Inflate the item until it feels very firm.

. Apply an even mixture from the prepared spray bottle and spread it with your hands, making the surface feel soapy.
** Look for expanding bubbles, which may take hours to appear unless pressure is applied to suspected areas.

== Applying Vinyl Glue

=== Safety Warnings
. Work outdoors if possible to minimize hazards.

. If working indoors:
** Ensure rapid air exhaustion using a high-velocity fan or similar.
** Avoid working near electronics, as sparks with fumes can cause flash fires.

. Wear a gas mask or painter respirator, such as the https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-770030L-North-Facepiece-Silicone/dp/B009SB4YUY[Honeywell North 7700 series]. Cheaper options like 3M exist but may require frequent replacement.

. Handle vinyl glue with nitrile gloves, as it is toxic before drying. Avoid latex gloves, which deteriorate on contact.

. Use vinyl no thicker than 0.4mm (16 gauge/16 mil) for patches or reinforcements. Thicker vinyl (0.6mm+) is difficult to cut, adheres poorly, and stresses surrounding material. For 0.3mm (12 gauge/12 mil) inflatables (e.g., from Inflatable World), match the thickness.

=== Seam Types and Information
. *Pinch seams*: Common and cost-effective; formed by pinching and welding vinyl. Recognizable by a raised lip.
** Prone to splitting under stress; reinforce by gluing a vinyl strip over the seam to bond both sides.

. *Negative curves*: Curved pinch seams (e.g., head to nose). Identified by higher tension.
** Reinforce similarly to pinch seams.

. *Flat seams*: Durable and costly; overlapping vinyl welded on both sides. Generally do not require repair.

=== Application Guidance
. Purchase glue:
** https://rhadhesives.com/product/hh-66-vinyl-cement-product/[HH-66 Vinyl Cement] (gold standard, though availability varies by country).
** https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_vinyl_fabricplasticflexibleadhesive.html[Loctite Vinyl, Fabric & Plastic Adhesive] (higher price, easier application but lower quality).

. Acquire tools:
** Rotary cutter: https://www.amazon.com/Olfa-Deluxe-Rotary-Cutter-60mm/dp/B001CE5DLE[Olfa's 60mm ergonomic model] for ease and replaceable blades.
** Brayer roller: https://www.amazon.com/VinBee-Rubber-Brayer-Applicator-Painting/dp/B07R8PMSVB[VinBee's soft rubber tool] (avoid latex-containing options).
** Paper guillotine: https://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-Heavy-Guillotine-Trimmer-Inches/dp/B0006HVQH8[X-ACTO 15"] for value and size.
** Scissors: Tim Holtz https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Holtz-Small-Titanium-Scissors/dp/B0013JNERS[7 inch] for trimming miscuts and https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Holtz-Scissors-All-Purpose/dp/B00JG9OV5G[9.5 inch] for cutting strips (use guillotine when possible).
** Practice items: Multiple https://www.amazon.com/Intex-Whale-Inflatable-Pool-Ride/dp/B00004YTPV[Intex Orcas] for chamber separation and seam reinforcement; https://www.amazon.com/Intex-Unicorn-Inflatable-Ride-Float/dp/B073685W74[Intex Unicorn Ride-Ons] for negative seams.

. Cut vinyl:
** Use rotary cutter along a ruler on a self-healing mat (OLFA or Dahle brand) for straight cuts.
** Correct veering with scissors.
** Use guillotine for precise cuts on smaller sheets; sizes vary by inflatable.

. Dispense glue: Fill a 10mL syringe with HH-66, attach a 19- or 20-gauge blunt tip (lower gauge leaks; higher is too restrictive). Avoid air in syringe.

. Clean surfaces: Use UV flashlight for inspection; wear polycarbonate goggles (e.g., https://www.amazon.com/NoCry-Safety-Goggles-Over-Glasses/dp/B08Y5JTKMQ[NoCry ANSI Z87.1] or https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8[Tool Klean]). Reference: 1lumen's "https://1lumen.com/best-uv-flashlight[The Best UV Flashlights tested]".

. Apply glue:
** Evenly and thinly.
** Work in sections slowly.
** Avoid excess in one area.

=== Tips and Tricks
. Heat (e.g., from sunlight) aids glue removal.

. Glue pinhole leaks while inflated and soapy: See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nekhnT0rI&list=PL5_NdwXbrBVsTo8x8MIfr6TTWFCJoZ9Xp&index=9&pp=iAQB[video example].

== [TODO] Vinyl Glue Removal
. Use https://rhadhesives.com/product/hh-66-thinner/[HH-66 Thinner] or acetone via blunt-tip syringes (avoid cotton swabs).
. Combine with hair dryer for residue removal.

== Purchasing DINP Plasticizer

=== Benefits of DINP Over ATBC
- Greater elasticity, no paint damage, reduced leaching from skin oils/sunlight. May prevent paint cracking by enhancing flexibility.

- ATBC is safer health-wise but harmful to inflatables; no assistance provided for it.

- DINP's risks are lower than other phthalates (e.g., DEP, DEHP), especially non-aerosol forms.

=== Key Studies on DINP Health Effects (Read in Order)
. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7460375/
. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8677456/
. https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-01/16.-dinp-.-exposure-consumer-indoor-dust-.-public-release-.-hero-.-jan-2025.pdf

=== Safety Warnings
. Higher exposure from mouthing DINP-treated vinyl (per EPA).

. Use nitrile gloves during application; wash skin contact immediately (5% absorption rate).

. Apply internally via valve for safety, but this weakens seams.

. Alibaba sellers overcharge (~$100/kg + $80+ shipping).

. Some suppliers (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich) restrict to approved buyers.

. Beware diluted products (e.g., with sunflower oil, harmful to inflatables).

. From FL Outdoor Fitness Store: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807644345558.html[Link 1], https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807969711719.html[Link 2] (~$3.62 USD for 5).
. From https://candycoatedus.com/new-large-double-bung-valves-3-pack/[Candy Coated Squeaks] (overpriced but fast shipping).

== Enlarging an Inflatable
CAUTION: This weakens seams and causes permanent deformation.

.Methods include:
. Prolonged direct sunlight exposure.

. Using a steam cleaner to inject steam.

. Over-inflating for 3 days (accelerated by high humidity/temperature).
