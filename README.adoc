== Storage
. Getting all air out of an inflatable makes it hard to fold. Keep some air in, fold it, then vaccum seal it off if desired.

. Store vinyl or latex inflatables inside of undyed & unwaxed cotton bags (called "canvas bags"); they must look similar to this in color: +
image:LEAFICO_cotton_bags.jpg[480,240]

. Do not store inflatables in:
- Plastic bags (Ziploc, etc.), it leeches plasticizers out.
- Dyed/pigmented fabric bags, they will permanently stain vinyl.

. Leave the inflatable's valves open to prevent mold build-up while in storage.

. Ensure the inflatable is dry, as vinyl can also mold on the outside.


== Cleaning
* A pencil eraser can get rid of undesirable marks/scuffs. While the eraser is dry, try using it on an inflatable; if that doesn't work, then wet the area with water and try erasing again.

.Recommended for at least once a week while in active use:
. Get a 950 mL (32 oz) spray bottle, fill it half-way with warm water, put 45 mL (3 tablespoons) of *non-concentrated* dish soap into the bottle, then finish the bottle up with warm water.

. Have two microfiber cloths. One for wiping off soap, and the other for further drying.

== Finding leaks
. Inflate until it feels over-inflated and very firm.

. Spray with an even ratio of the bottle you've made, and spread it around with your hands. Ensure your inflatable feels like a bar of soap.
Look for expanded bubbles; this may take up to hours to appear, unless you apply pressure to areas you think will leak.


== Trimming vinyl to make strips
* Use a Paper Guillotine to make precise cuts on small sheets of vinyl.

- If the vinyl is too large for a Paper Guillotine, use a rotary cutter alongside a measuring object, such as a cutting mat with a ruler painted on.


== Handling an inflatable

. Vinyl-safe lubes:
- *Storage safe:* Corn starch, unscented talcum powder (not recommended).
- *Temporary use only:* Silicone lube, Petroleum Jelly.

. Latex-safe lubes:
- *Storage safe:* Unscented talcum powder.
- *Temporary use only:* Silicone lube.

. Avoid for long-periods of time:
- Leaving an vinyl or latex on a hangar.
- Having the vinyl or latex touch itself. 


== Applying vinyl glue

=== Warnings
. Ensure you can exhaust air out of your workshop quickly by using a high-velocity fan or other means.

. Never work around electronics; sparks mixed in with gas fumes can start a flash fire.

. Wear a gas mask or painter respirator.
- You can start looking at gas masks https://gasmaskandrespirator.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Current[here].

. Or ignore the above by simply working outdoors, and not near a power outlet.


=== Tips
. Use a 19 or 20 gauge syringe tip, which ever you prefer.
- Too low of a gauge will leak out glue, too high makes it impossible to get glue out.

. Do not have air inside of the syringe holding the vinyl glue, it will cause the glue to leak out.

. Use a UV flashlight to see if the vinyl's surface is clean before applying glue to it.

. Vinyl glue is toxic before it dries. Wear nitrile gloves while handling.
- Avoid latex gloves, they deteriorate on contact with vinyl glue.

. Heat acts as removal for vinyl glue, and so does direct sunlight. Keep it in mind.

. To ensure the glue does its job:
- Apply the glue evenly and thinly, and glue all of what the vinyl patch will contact. 
- Do not apply too much glue in a given area.


== Buying ATBC plasticizer
NOTE: DINP is a more effective plasticizer than ATBC, via: more elasticity, resistance against skin oils, and less plasticizer leeching. +
If you do not trust the safety of DINP, ATBC is the go-to.

== Buying DINP plasticizer
=== Warnings
. Sellers from Alibaba overcharge greatly; their average cost for 1kg/1000mL is around $100, plus $80 or more shipping.
. Some chemical companies such as Sigma-Aldrich only sell to chemists that work for a university or via your company's approval.
- This also applies to the sale of ATBC.
. Bad sellers could mix in sunflower oil or water into the DINP as a way to cheap out; the sunflower oil is harmful to inflatables.
. Wear nitrile gloves to protect yourself from DINP (or ATBC) while applying it to an inflatable.

== Tools

=== Vinyl glue

. https://rhadhesives.com/product/hh-66-vinyl-cement-product/[HH-66 Vinyl Cement] is the gold standard, though some countries cannot purchase this locally.

. https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_vinyl_fabricplasticflexibleadhesive.html[Loctite Vinyl, Fabric & Plastic Adhesive] is much higher price than HH-66 and not as high quality, but is easy to apply.

=== Vinyl glue removal
. https://rhadhesives.com/product/hh-66-thinner/[HH-66 Thinner] or Acetone.

=== For inflating
* United States: https://www.amazon.com/Texsport-Double-Action-Hand-Mattress/dp/B000P9IRVK[Texsport's Double Action Hand Pump] is high quality for the price.

=== Self-healing cutting mat
- Quality brands: Dahle, OLFA

=== Stainless steel rotary cutter
- Quality brands: OLFA

TIP: Do not cheap out, as you'll end up spending more money later after being frustrated with blades that mess up your vinyl cuts. Avoid the Fiskers brand and all no-name brands.

=== Brayer Roller
. Do not use Brayer Rollers that contain any latex (natural rubber).

=== UV Flashlight
Read 1lumen's "https://1lumen.com/best-uv-flashlight[The Best UV Flashlights tested]".

CAUTION: Without eye protection, your eyes will hurt while using a UV flashlight, and in the long-term you risk permanent eye-sight damage.

.What can be done?
* Wear polycarbonate safety glasses or goggles with at least the ANSI Z87.1-2020 certification.

- The https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8[NoCry 6X3 goggles] or https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8[Tool Klean Safety Glasses] are suitable.


== Enlarging an inflatable
CAUTION: This results permanently in weakened seams and deformation.

.The following methods to do this are:
. Exposing the toy to direct sun-light for a long time.

. Using a steam cleaner to push steam into the toy.

. Leaving an inflatable over-inflated for 3 days; higher humidity or higher temperature will accelerate this process.

. Known harmful for contact with vinyl:
- Baby oil, Coconut oil, Mineral oil, Water-based lube, Vegetable oil, Lithium grease, WD-40 (and other sprays containing solvents).
- Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline) is safe for vinyl, but unsafe for latex.
- Non-vinyl glues, such as Gorilla Glue and other superglue products.
- Duct tape and other forms of tape not made for vinyl.

. Going above 0.4mm (16 gauge/16 mil) thick vinyl. 0.6mm and above will have problems sticking to seams and vinyl glue, and lowers durability by over-stressing the surrounding vinyl.
