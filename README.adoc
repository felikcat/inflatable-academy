== Handling
.Avoid contact with vinyl if your skin has one of the following:
- Baby oil, Coconut oil, Mineral oil, Water-based lube, Vegetable oil, Lithium grease (has small amounts of mineral oil), WD-40 (and other sprays containing solvents).
- Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline) is safe for vinyl, but unsafe for latex.

.What can contact with vinyl safely:
- Safe for storage: Talcum powder.
- Unsafe for storage: Silicone lube, Petroleum Jelly.

.Vinyl can be stretched out further than normal for bigger inflation, but will degrade the vinyl and make seams weakened.
- The following methods to do this are:
** Exposing the toy to direct sun-light for a long time.
** Using a steam cleaner to push steam into the toy.

. Use 0.3mm (thinner) up to 0.4mm (thicker & stiffer) vinyl for your repairs.
** 0.3 mm = 12 gauge/12 mil, 0.4mm = 16 gauge/16 mil.
** Too stiff of vinyl (at or above 0.6mm) will transfer more stress to its surroundings, and that vinyl won't stick to the glue as much.

. Avoid using the following:
** Non-vinyl glues, such as Gorilla Glue and other superglue products.
** Duct tape and other forms of tape not meant for Vinyl.
** 1mm thick vinyl has problems sticking to seams. Use 0.4mm instead.


== Storage
* Dyed/pigmented fabric bags will permanently stain vinyl.

* Leave the toy's valves open to prevent mold build-up while in storage.


== Cleaning
. Use shampoos without conditioners and minerals, such as the https://smartlabel.unileverusa.com/079400587602-0002-en-US/index.html[Suave Essentials - Ocean Breeze].

. Fill a 950 mL (32 oz) spray bottle half-way with warm water, then put 45 mL (3 tablespoons) of shampoo into the bottle, then fill the bottle to completion with warm water.

. Wipe off the inflatable using a microfiber cloth soaked in warm water.


== Finding leaks
. Spray the entire toy, wait a few hours, then look for expanded bubbles. Some leaks are noticeable after a few minutes.
** Avoid leaving the soap on for beyond half a day, it can leech plasticizers which damages the toy.


== Trimming vinyl to make strips
* To cut vinyl that's too large currently for a Paper Guillotine, use a rotary cutter alongside a measuring object, likely a cutting mat with a ruler painted on.
* Use a Paper Guillotine to make precise cuts on small sheets of vinyl.


== Applying vinyl glue

. Use a UV flashlight to see if the vinyl's surface is clean before applying glue to it.

. Vinyl glue is toxic before it dries. Wear nitrile gloves while handling.
- Avoid latex gloves, they deteriorate on contact with vinyl glue.
. Heat acts as removal for vinyl glue; avoid gluing while in direct sunlight.

. To ensure the glue does its job:
- Apply the glue evenly and thinly, and glue all of what the vinyl patch will contact. 
- Do not apply too much glue in a given area.


== Products

.We need an inflation tool that safely inflates or deflates.
** For the United States: https://www.amazon.com/Texsport-Double-Action-Hand-Mattress/dp/B000P9IRVK[Texsport's Double Action Hand Pump] is high quality.


.Self-healing cutting mat
- Quality brands: Dahle, OLFA


.Stainless steel rotary cutter
- Quality brands: OLFA
** Do not cheap out on these, as you'll end up spending more money later after being frustrated with blades that mess up your vinyl cuts. Avoid the Fiskers brand and all no-name brands.


.Brayer Roller
- Do not use Brayer Rollers that contain any latex (natural rubber).


.Vinyl Glue
. `HH-66 Vinyl Cement`: the gold standard, though some countries cannot purchase this locally.
. `Loctite Vinyl, Fabric & Plastic Adhesive`: much higher price than HH-66 and not as high quality.

.Vinyl Glue removers
. `HH-66 Thinner`.


.UV Flashlight
. Read 1lumen's "https://1lumen.com/best-uv-flashlight[The Best UV Flashlights tested]".
. WARNING: Your eyes will hurt while using a UV flashlight as an immediate effect. Long-term there is risk of permanent eye-sight damage.

- What can be done?
* Wear polycarbonate safety glasses or goggles with at least the ANSI Z87.1-2020 certification.

* The NoCry 6X3 goggles are suitable for many blue collar use-cases, while also protecting against UV light.

* For white collar work, these https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8[safety glasses] from Tool Klean have the bonus of blocking blue light enough to lessen circadian rhythm disruption (from displays, like TVs and monitors).
